## Ensonic's articles and web app experiemnts

On this page I'll host some articles and publish some web experiemnts.

### Web app experiments

* [app skeleton](apps/skel/index.html)
* [midi keyboard](apps/keys/index.html)
  * Based on these [webmidi-examples](https://webmidi-examples.glitch.me/) and
    this [piano keyboard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-piano-keyboard/)

To serve an app for local development, run:

```bash
cd apps/<appname>
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
